write documentation for rememberscript

Giving sentences ids so it's easier to test

Have example inputs for triggers? Don't want to clutter the script though
Maybe put examples in a separate file? Or, have an "examples" key on a trigger
and point it to a variable in the pyr file

Rename pyr to py again, only reason for that was for pytest, not worth it...
